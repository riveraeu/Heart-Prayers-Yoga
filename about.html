          <p><i>“I slept and dreamt that life was joy.
            I awoke and saw that life was service.
            I acted and behold, service was joy.”</i>
            – Tagore</p>
          <p>My name is Jane Rivera. A bad back brought me to yoga many years ago. Under the guidance of my dear teacher,
            Sherri Baptiste, I quickly realized that yoga was a tool for living my life to its highest potential.
            I delved into study and practice, and found a way of living that gives me an inner foundation of peace,
            compassion, and connectedness. It is now my passion and privilege to share this beautiful gift with others.
          </p>
          <p>Jane Rivera, RYT (registered yoga teacher) 500 hour, is certified by Sherri Baptiste Power of Yoga.</p>
          <p>Over the past 15 years, Jane has studied Yoga with Sherri Baptiste, daughter, and  Michele Herbert, long time student,  of Walt Baptiste.
          Walt Baptiste was a pioneer of yoga and wellness in San Francisco in the 1950s.</p>
          <p>Jane has devoted years of study with authentic  Indian  teachers A.G. Mohan and Indra Mohan, who were direct students of Krishnamacharya.
          Jane attended one of the last workshops  in 2009 given by TKV Desikachar, son of Krishnamacharya.</p>
          <p>Jane received her Advanced  Relax and Renew Restorative Yoga teacher Certification from Judith Hanson Laseter in 2016.</p>
          <p>For the past 10 years Jane has been teaching  weekly classes of Gentle Yoga and Restorative Yoga to all ages at the Marin Osher JCC in San Rafael.
          Having a natural fondness for seniors, Jane leads 70 and 80 year olds in a Gentle Yoga class that can be enjoyed by all levels of ability.</p>
          <p class="dark">
            <b>Seniors:</b><br>
            Yoga is for all ages and its benefits can be enjoyed for a lifetime.  The inner practices of pranayama, mantra, mudra, and meditation are ageless.
            Jane shares her experience with these practices in working with elders.
            Seniors who thought they could never take a group yoga class are now able to come and experience the essence of yoga in their lives.
            Join Jane in sampling the diverse offerings of yoga and a review of the pros and cons of different asanas as they relate to senior  needs and abilities.
